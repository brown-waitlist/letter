        Dear Brown University Admissions,
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d first like to thank you for offering me a place on Brown’s transfer waitlist. Brown University is by far my top choice school, and if I were to be accepted off the waitlist, I would be humbled and eager to attend.

        Brown’s flexible approach to learning, combined with its rigorous academics in its Open Curriculum will enable me to thrive by challenging me while still allowing me to explore my wide reaching interests. Last semester, I was the only computer science major in my honors course on architectural history, Architecture and Global Cultures. This summer, I’ve been self studying computer science applications of linear algebra through Brown’s very own course CS053, Coding the Matrix.

        Since applying to Brown, I’ve worked hard to improve my academics, while still maintaining devoted to my personal passions — I finished my spring semester with straight A’s in all classes. As part of the student lead design studio, Scout, I worked with a team of designers to develop an editorial website for Experience Magazine, a project by Northeastern University launching later this year. My research position at the Collaborative Social Systems Lab culminated in a finalist presentation at the Northeastern’s RISE research fair for my work. I’ve also continued my outreach of computer science by mentoring at MetroHacks, a high school hackathon, where I put together an impromptu beginners workshop. I’ve become a stronger collaborator and thinker, thanks to these experiences.

        Once again, thank you so much for the opportunity to be on Brown’s waitlist. Brown University is the only place really for me, and I hope to someday call myself a proud Brown Bear.
