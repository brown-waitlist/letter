        Dear Brown University Admissions,
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d first like to thank you for offering me a place on Brown’s transfer waitlist. Brown University is by far my top choice school, and if I were to be accepted off the waitlist, I would be humbled and eager to attend.

        Brown’s flexible approach to learning, combined with its rigorous academics in its Open Curriculum will enable me to thrive by challenging me while still allowing me to explore my wide reaching interests. Last semester, I was the only computer science major in my honors course on architectural history, Architecture and Global Cultures. This summer, I’ve been self studying computer science applications of linear algebra through the public resources of Brown’s very own course CS053, Coding the Matrix.
